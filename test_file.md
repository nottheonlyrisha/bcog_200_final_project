## Test 1
select `moderate` from the `tempo` selection buttons

slide the countdown to `4`

make note of how fast the countdown is - after the countdown, tap out five beats at the _same speed_ the countdown was, and click `submit`

take a screenshot of the resulting rhythm sheet music - 4 quarter notes!

## Test 2
select `slow` from the `tempo` selection buttons

slide the countdown to `3` or `2`

after the countdown, tap out two beats at the same speed as the countdown, then two beats _twice as fast_, then another 2 beats the same speed as the countdown before clicking `submit`

the resulting rhythm should be 2 quarter notes, 2 eighth notes, and 1 more quarter note!

## Test 3
select `fast` from the `tempo` selection buttons

slide the countdown to `4` or higher (`fast` is _very_ fast, so you may need a couple more beats of preparation)

after the countdown, tap out two beats _half_ the speed of the flashes, then two beats that are _four_ flashes' worth in length

click `submit` to view the resulting rhythm, which should be two half notes and a whole note!
