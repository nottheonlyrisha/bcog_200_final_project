# BCOG 200 Final Project Documentation
## The Basics
This program can be used to create notation for rhythms that a user taps out. Based on a selected tempo, or speed (which determines the lengths of notes used), the tapped rhythms will be translated into visible sheet music.
## The Code
This program will be contained in a class, like a GUI, and output different Tkinter screens correcponding to and recording user selection and interactions.
### Selection Screen
This screen includes three tempo options as buttons, and a slider to select how many beats are in the countoff (which ranges from 2 to 8 beats).
### Countoff Screen
This is the screen where the chosen number of countoff beats will be displayed at the chosen tempo. The entire screen will flash in time, and the amount of times that the user chooses.
### Rhythm Entry Screen
On this screen, a small box will flash whenever the user taps the space bar. There will also be a submit button, which (as per the prior warning) will omit the last click.
### Loading Screen
This screen might include a progress bar.
### Final Rhythm Screen
This screen will display the final rhythm. If I can find a way to make the final rhythm into a downloadable PNG or other image, there will be a button to download the final sheet music.
## Uses
This program could be used to determine notation for a possible song, drumline, or assist in arranging music. It could also be used for fun!
